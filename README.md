## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**VedangW/VedangW** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working as a Machine Learning researcher at the [Freundlich Lab](https://njms.rutgers.edu/departments/labs/freundlich/) at Rutgers University. The goal of my research is an efficient search of drug candidates by developing ML models for Molecular Property Prediction.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about traditional ML and Deep Learning models for NLP, CV, and Drug Discovery. I also know about the ML model lifecycle (feature engineering, training, deployment, monitoring) for batch and real-time inference.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently interested in learning about scaling real-time ML model pipelines, Causal Inference, Search algorithms, and Generative models for Drug Discovery.
